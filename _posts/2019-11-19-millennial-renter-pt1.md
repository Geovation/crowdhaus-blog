Excitement.

Anticipation.

Full of hope...

This can only mean one thing; we’re about to start our city rental journey for the first time and our browsers are filled will a multitude of properties that seem perfect.

*----- One Year Later ----*

Dread.

Despair.

A glimmer of hope...

This can only mean one thing; our lease is up, and we are falling back into the property search cesspit most city dwelling millennials have navigated one too manytimes.

Each and every one of us has fallen into one of the anecdotal characters above. Each and every one of us has a story to tell, starting with joy and excitement, followed by disappointment and frustration (at some stage of the process).

As the co-founder of a proptech start-up, I’ll be sharing with you my thoughts on why renting is not necessarily the poor-man’s version of buying, as well as my most recent rental experience – paying homage to why building crowdhaüs became a must for us, and not just a side-hustle or opportunity to gift myself the title “entrepreneur”. (I still find it quite nauseating using that term personally, I guess it could be imposter syndrome at its finest, but feel free to refer to me as “The Entrepreneur” any time you like).

Now that in-text plug is out the way – cough, @crowdhaus, give us a follow, cough – we are here to talk about the millennial renter. And whilst we can all research the percentage facts and benefits as to why Gen Y are forming the new rental generation, one thing appears to escape the mainstream discussion. All the little details, the to-ing and fro-ing and the emotional rollercoaster that is packaged into our little friend known as - The Search.

A perfect storm.

A gateway into our future.

The part we have most control of... or do we, but we will save that conversation for part 2 of this blog.

Today we are going to talk about why renting isn’t just our only option, but it’s also a good option that suits our current juncture in life. The world we have been exposed to, and the way in which our innate interests differ to that of our forefathers (or in less philosophical terms, our parents), the rental world suits us – and whilst it’s nothing groundbreaking, I’ll give you my reasons why.

We have been engrained to think that an equity stake in a property - which is all it isunless you buy outright – is a sign of adulting, and a milestone on our path through adulthood. This is a very UK/US  centric school of thought, and probably what contributed to the housing crisis in 2008, but that’s a conversation I’m not well equipped enough to open a discussion on. Europe however, favours the rental route over homeownership, to a much greater extent than its western world brothers.

High on the list for the millennial renter is **flexibility** – an opportunity to live in edgy, chic or boujee places that we could never afford to buy in; certainly not until this corporate engine spits us out the other side. We also happen to be a fickle bunch, renting gives us the chance to leave and explore new areas, ditch that annoying housemate, move in with partners or sometimes your best friends from school if the stars so happen to align. This is something I like to call the *co-habitation conundrum* – who do we live with next? The possibilities are endless. All down to the beauty of a lease - *it comes to an end*.

Flexibility is key to us millennials, as much in property as it is in our professions – who doesn’t love working from home, and the people whose companies are still in the dark ages and are without that flexibility – they long for it.

**Responsibility** is next up.

Responsibility? No thanks.

“Hi \*insert generic estate agent\*, our tap is leaking can we get this sorted please?”

Problem solved, and for the most part, the cost doesn’t fall on our plate. Let’s leave the responsibility to those who want it. Not us. *Side note: my co-founder just stepped onto the property ladder, huge expense, evenings spent sanding down floors, but at last, he’s made it... he’s on the property ladder.*

Knock knock.

Who’s there?

Responsibility...

Responsibility who? The responsibility of fixing this bloody boiler that’s just broken down 2 weeks into home ownership. £5000, wank you very much.

*Yes, that happened to him. LOL. Sorry Matt. But at least you’re a homeowner, right pal? God I sound bitter, but you get the sentiment right?*

Whilst we are on this point of responsibility, if your neighbor calls the council because you had a quiet gathering until 5am... ah well, flexibility kicks back in, we’re off at the end of the lease – not our problem. (that’s a joke, don’t piss off the neighbours, peaceful street harmony makes for a happy life).

And finally on our list, is the fact it’s a genuinely affordable **property ladder** alternative.

Bank of mum and dad dried up?

Never even existed?

I myself am in camp number 2...

Unfortunately, my parent’s didn’t work hard enough to buy me a little house all to myself, was that really too much to ask? Joke Mum, you’ve done great, but the fact remains the same, the gulf in deposit size for rent and for purchase is astronomical – and it’s only getting bigger.

A comparatively small deposit required for rent – now that is something I can do... just about.

The property landscape has forced most of us into the rental market. Whilst our parents were blessed with ample opportunity to buy homes with 100% mortgages and relatively cheap prices – we are where we are. So let’s enjoy it. Our choice is ultimately limited, but we are free to do this rental dance well into our thirties and we shouldn’t be afraid of that. There are so many benefits to renting, some of whichare highlighted above and others which are down to personal preference.

And now we finally make it to my rental experience, let me set the scene for you.

I’m sharing a house in southwest London, with my best mates from school – it’s great. Could I be doing that as a home-owner, probably not.

Now, let’s go deeper into our house.

Is that an island in the middle of the kitchen, with oodles of sunlight streaming onto it from skylight windows and bi-folding doors? Why yes, yes it is. Thing of beauty ain’t it? God I love bi-folding doors.

Now, could I afford a kitchen, with an island, skylight windows and bi-folding doors? Absolutely not. But there we have it – this is mine for now. **Flexibility**.

New scene. It’s 6am, I’m in my bedroom – the first whispers of morning light are creeping through the ceiling high windows. I’m suddenly awake, and no, it’s not from the warm touch of the sun’s gentle rays on my skin... it’s the neighbour’s baby, screaming his nut off again; that’s the 3rd time this week Hugo.

*(I don’t actually know the babies name, but the name Hugo sounded fitting).*

Ah well, only 10 more months of this and flexibility has me onto the next place. So there we have it, if you’re a landlord reading this in the SW London area who happens to own a 4 bedroom house, with a kitchen that possesses an island, skylight windows and bi-folding doors – hit me up.

For the rest of you, if you’ve gotten this far, I really appreciate you taking the time out to read this. It’s not just the ramblings of a narcissistic **entrepreneur**, “The Entrepreneur” as we agreed, I promise there is a purpose. It’s also quite enjoyable to share our stories in something we’ve all experienced.

Please do like and share if you enjoyed it, and if you didn’t, it’s literally one button – just press it. We’ll be following this up with Part 2 of The Millennial Renter, where thefocus will be on The Search. The part where we are actually jumping onto those property portals for hours on end; being hounded by agents who are thrusting properties at you which you have no interest in and a first-hand torrid experience of losing my post-University rental virginity. She was a beauty.

The Search is something that is very close to our hearts, so those of you who know crowdhaüs already, will know we are now dedicating our lives to this – literally. ‘Til next time renters, and to any b&$tard millennial owners that have found their way here – JK – just jealous – see you next time!
